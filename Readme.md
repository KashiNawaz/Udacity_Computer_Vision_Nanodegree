# Computer Vision Nanodegree

This repository contains project files for Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree program which I enrolled on 24 April, 2018.

### Projects:

### Facial Keypoint Detection

Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.

### Automatic Image Captioning

Combine CNN and RNN knowledge to build a deep learning model that produces captions given an imput image.

### Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM)

Implement Graph SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world
