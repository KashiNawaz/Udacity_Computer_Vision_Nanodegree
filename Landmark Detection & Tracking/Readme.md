# Project : Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)
## Description
we implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world. We combine robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.

SLAM gives us a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
